# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project represents my first attempt at building a personal portfolio to showcase my skills and experiences. I'm excited to share it with you, even though I haven't made significant updates since its initial creation.

## About the Project

This portfolio website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an overview of my background, education, skills, and experiences. While the design and features may not be as polished as I'd like them to be, this portfolio serves as a snapshot of my journey as a developer up to this point.

## Sections

The portfolio website consists of the following sections:

- **About:** Introduces myself and provides a glimpse into my interests and aspirations.
- **Education:** Displays my academic accomplishments and educational path.
- **Experience:** Highlights my internships, roles of responsibility, and involvement in various projects.
- **Skills:** Showcases the programming languages, technologies, and tools I have experience with (newly added).
- **Contact:** Provides ways to get in touch with me.

## The Decision to Upload

I've decided to upload this portfolio without major changes because I believe in transparency and growth. While I recognize that there's room for improvement, I want to capture this moment in my development journey. In the future, I plan to make enhancements and updates to better represent my evolving skills and experiences.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio repository!
